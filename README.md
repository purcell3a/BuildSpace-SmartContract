# BuildSpace-SmartContract

This is my first project on the blockchain. 

I've followed the tutorial pretty closely while I get my feet wet and I recommend it for anyone hoping to get a basic understanding with smart contracts. 

I did not do parts 4 & 5. They were considerably focused on UI and editing which wasn't my reason for going through the course.
